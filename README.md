Petroleum has a significant share in the world energy matrix, its derivatives being used in several different areas. Such a product has different physical and chemical properties, which directly interfere in the calculation of its commercial value. The present work, therefore, has as main objective to carry out an exploratory statistical analysis, aiming to investigate possible correlations between the characteristics (TAN, ºAPI, sulfur and nitrogen) that directly interfere in the calculation of the national oil reference price. For the analysis, the database made available by the _Agência do Petróleo, Gás e Biocombustíveis_ – ANP, was imported into the Python computational language. Visual and data science tools were used through the Google Colab platform. The graphs generated from the chemical characteristics show similar descending dispersions, that is, there is a depreciation in the market value of oil, since such properties are considered contaminants, which makes the extraction, transportation and refining processes of oil difficult. On the other hand, it was noticed that the physical property ºAPI has a strong correlation with the price, evidenced by an upward dispersion, that is, samples with higher degrees, have greater commercial value. Therefore, it is concluded that the exploratory analysis of the database proved to be relevant in understanding the effect of oil quality as a function of price, as calculated by the ANP.
